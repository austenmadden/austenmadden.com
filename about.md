# About
Appreciate your interest! I spend my time at [CoverMyMeds](https://covermymeds.com) working to improve the healthcare experience, primarily developing [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) applications. I enjoy full-stack development, getting to work with all the tools and languages needed to bring a modern application to an end user. While I'm by no means an expert, I've recently enjoyed exploring functional programming via [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and I am hoping to ship an application using [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) someday.
