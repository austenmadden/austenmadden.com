# About
Appreciate your interest! I spend my time at [Data-Axle](https://data-axle.com) working with lots of data. Previously, I worked at [CoverMyMeds](https://covermymeds.com). I enjoy full-stack development, getting to work with all the tools and languages needed to bring a modern application to an end user.
